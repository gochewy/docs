Welcome to the Chewy Stack! üêÜüòä 

In this document we'll cover the following:

1. [What is the Chewy Stack?](#what-is-the-chewy-stack)
2. [Can the Chewy Stack help me?](#can-the-chewy-stack-help-me)
3. [Why should I choose the Chewy Stack?](#why-should-i-choose-the-chewy-stack)

The idea is to help you determine if the Chewy Stack is a good fit for you and why you might want to choose the Chewy Stack over other comparable tools. We believe the Chewy Stack can help a wide variety of developers to get projects off the ground, but we acknowledge that it's not going to be everyone's cup of tea. ‚òïÔ∏è 

So let's go ahead and figure out if it's right for *you*.


## What is the Chewy Stack?

_*The Chewy Stack is a [deep stack framework](./overview/deep-stack-framework) which aims to get developer from zero to scalable product faster than anything else out there*_

If you've made it here, you've probably come across other dev stacks like LAMP, MERN, MEAN, or even ones without funky acronyms, like Ruby + Rails + Postgres (RRP?). Chewy is similar, but with two key differences:

1. ### The Chewy Stack uses a micro-service architecture
The Chewy Stack aims to provide the advantages of microservices, while maintaining the developer-experience simplicity of a monolith. [Read more](./overview/microservices)

2. ### We're making up a new word. We're calling the Chewy Stack a "*deep stack framework*." 
Full-stack frameworks provide structure to your application, but don't do much around deployment. A "deep stack framework" is one in which the infrastructure is explicitly *part* of the framework. [Read more](./overview/deep-stack-framework)


## Can the Chewy Stack help me?

In short, if you're building a new web or mobile app... probably? 

Part of our mission is to make complexity simple to manage. We also aim to make Chewy accessible for developers of all levels. For that reason, we're making certain tradeoffs, which won't make sense for everyone. That being said, if you like TypeScript, GraphQL, and React, and you like building products fast, the Chewy Stack is probably for you.

We haven't completely ironed out how this is going to work, but we also want to make things flexible and extensible. So if you like kubernetes and managing infrastructure, we hope the Chewy Stack will provide a base for you to build some really cool systems.


## Why should I choose the Chewy Stack?

You should choose the Chewy Stack if you fit the following criteria:

1. You want an opinionated framework so you can start building, rather than choosing components.
2. You like (or ideally love üß°) TypeScript, React, and GraphQL
3. You want to be able to connect to your cloud provider to our CLI and instantly provision infrastructure and deploy all services.
