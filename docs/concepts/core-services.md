title: Core Services
---

The Chewy Stack is designed to be an extensible framework which people can use to build on our "deep stack" paradigm, but at its core, the idea is to help people build *better*, and *faster*. We accomplish that with the Chewy Stack's core services, which provide tools to manage authentication and authorization, GraphQL and REST API development, and data storage, as well as a web client. We plan on providing object storage in the near future as well.

Here is a basic diagram of the services and how they're organized:

<div
    dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
        __html: `
 <div style="width: 100%; height: 480px; margin: 10px; position: relative;"><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder="0" style="width:100%; height:480px" src="https://lucid.app/documents/embedded/133ce156-118a-468b-b1bd-4ac65417917a" id="aIHnOFmumofP"></iframe></div>       
        `
    }}
