title: Microservices
---

We've built products using existing frameworks designed around monolithic stacks and honestly? We love them. But we've also felt the pain of splitting them up as a product grows. Building a monolith is definitely easier in many ways when you're getting started, but it can add friction when a product's requirements become more complex as it grows.

The Chewy Stack aims to provide the advantages of microservices, while maintaining the developer-experience simplicity of a monolith.

The stack includes pre-configured environments to write your own frontend/backend code and manages a few additional open source services for things like auth, and more (see [Core Services](./core-services)). It also includes the necessary tooling to build and deploy every service to your own infrastructure while keeping everything coordinated.
