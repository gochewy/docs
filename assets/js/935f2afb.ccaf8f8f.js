The thing we found missing in those frameworks is they leave it up to the developer to figure out how they\'re going to deploy. Some of these frameworks can be deployed pretty easily to Heroku or other PaaS\'es, but they usually take some platform-dependent configuration that the developer has to figure out.","sidebar":"docs"},"philosophy/microservices":{"id":"philosophy/microservices","title":"Microservices","description":"We\'ve built products using existing frameworks designed around monolithic stacks and honestly?
